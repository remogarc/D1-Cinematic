# Key Requirements for Assignment:

- **3+ scenes**: The project has three separate scenes: the name of the
studio, the loading screen, and the title of the game.

- **2+ audio assets**: The two audio assets include the sound played when
the stars emerge in the third scene, and the sound played when they move
off screen. The first sound was from a clip on YouTube, that I sped up and
trimmed the ends of using Audacity. The second sound was recorded by
myself, that was edited using Audacity to change the pitch and speed.

- **2+ image assets**: The image assests used in the project include the
planet in the second scene, and the title text and spaceship in the third
scene. Both the planet and title text were created by me using Pixlr, while
the spaceship was used from the Noun Project, but I edited it in Pixlr to
color it in.

- **2+ geometric shapes**: The two geometric shapes included in the project
are the many stars that cover the screen in the third scene. All of these stars
are circles rendered with different sizes each.
 
- **1+ logotype**: The logotype is the title text that appears during the third
scene. This was created by myself using Pixlr.
 
- **1+ multi-line text**: The multi line text is present in the third scene,
which displays multiple options for a standard game, which was rendered in engine.
 
- **1+ fading animation**: A fading animation is present in between the first
and second scenes in which the background fades from white to black. Another
fading animation is present during the third scene when the scene transitions
from black to blue.
 
- **1+ object motion animation**: Multiple objects are in motion in the second
and third scenes. In the second scene, the planet is spinning. In the third
scene, the stars move to the top of the screen, with the text moving up from the
bottom, title moving in from the right, and the spaceship moving in shortly after.
